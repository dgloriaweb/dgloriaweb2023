            As a hobby in my free time as a side project I work on
            <a href="https://talentexploit.com" target="_blank">talentexploit.com</a>
            that uses a mysql database, sending API data through Laravel8 to a
            Vue3 frontend. I use Netlify to deploy frontend, DigitalOcean to
            store backend, VS Code and Github. This app is
            going to recommend career paths based on the user settings. I also
            work on an app that does future budget planning for households.

            The company has a marketing analytics solution product, similar to
            Google Analytics. I've joined a team of six helpful senior, highly
            qualified developers. My daily tasks were pick up story from JIRA and
            provide solution. My tasks were mostly to add new functions to
            existing code such as additional filters, new classes, provide data
            for the frontend, develop new integrations, do changes on the
            frontend, in the first quarter we completely rewrote the frontend
            design of the product. We have worked in two week sprints, by the
            end of the first quarter I have delivered solutions on my own. I
            worked mainly with LAMP, Php, javascript, jquery, twig, html and css
            in windows and linux environment, occasionally I did tech support in
            rotation with the team workers. I worked mostly in Codeigniter, but
            had to do bash file fixes, cron-jobs and API as well. I did a lot of
            mysql querying, building complex reports.

            I've worked in a team of three on the backend of the street hubs in
            Belfast. My task was to develop connection to a weather API service,
            retrieve formatted data and make sure it updates as required. Another
            API related task was to use Visit Belfast's API to allow smart hub 
            users to use their mobile phones to find ongoing events in Belfast by 
            providing a qr code, which opened Google maps with
            directions to the venue location. The backend also gives
            editors the ability to edit and approve these contents before it is
            submitted to the unit. I worked closely supporting the frontend and
            hardware team to build this device from zero to deploy within six
            months. I'm very proud of it. Another project I've worked on
            parallel was a document management software for a large company, 
            which is used by 5 departments so they always have an up 
            to date status of the documents, similar to docusign, but using the 
            same as part of the system.
