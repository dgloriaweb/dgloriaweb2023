            As a hobby in my free time in my side project I work on
            <a href="talentexploit.com" target="_blank">talentexploit.com</a>
            that uses a mysql database, sending API data through Laravel8 to a
            Vue3 frontend. I use Netlify to deploy frontend, DigitalOcean to
            store backend, vs code, Github for version control. This app is
            going to recommend career paths based on the user settings. I also
            work on an app that does future budget plannings for households. I
            am currently full time employed, I work for a CRM system provider. I
            code in Php, Js, CSS. I mostly do branding. My task is to make our
            system look exactly like the clients' current website. I've built 13
            websites in 12 months and made 5 full reskins. It's a challenge
            since we don't use anything else but html, css and bootstrap, while
            our clients use the latest WP, Wix and other fancy stuff.

            The company has a marketing analytics solution product, similar to
            Google Analytics. I've joined a team of six helpful senior, highly
            qualified developers. My daily tasks were pickup story from JIRA and
            provide solution. My tasks were mostly to add new functions to
            existing code such as additional filters, new classes, provide data
            for the frontend, develop new integrations, do changes on the
            frontend, in the first quarter we completely rewrote the frontend
            design of the product. We have worked in two week sprints, by the
            end of the first quarter I have delivered solutions on my own. I
            worked mainly with LAMP, Php, javascript, jquery, twig, html and css
            in windows and linux environment, occasionaly I did tech support in
            rotation with the team workers. I worked mostly in Codeigniter, but
            had to do bash file fixes, cron-jobs and API as well. I did a lot of
            mysql querying, building complex reports.

            I've worked in a team of three on the backend of the street hubs in
            Belfast. My task was to develop connection to a weather service,
            retrieve formatted data and make sure it updates as required. Other
            task was to allow smarthub users to use their mobile phones to find
            venues with ongoing events in Belfast by providing them info about
            current events, showing a qr code, which opened Google maps with
            directions to the venue location. Fancy. The backend also gave
            editors ability to edit and approve these contents before it is
            submitted to the unit. I worked closely supporting the frontend and
            hardware team to build this device from zero to working within six
            months. I'm very proud of it. Another project I've worked on
            parallel was a document management software for a large company.
            It's a tool which allows 5 departments to communicate and store
            their status of workflow.
